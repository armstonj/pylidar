How to create a distribution of PyLidar. 

1. Ensure that you have fetched and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the pylidar/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
3. Use "hg tag" to add a version number tag, e.g.
    hg tag pylidar-0.4.0
4. Create the distribution tarball, using
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
   This creates both a tar.gz and a zip, under a subdirectory called dist
5. Upload these to bitbucket, under the downloads tab. 


Version Numbers.
The TuiView number is structured as A.B.C. 
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
