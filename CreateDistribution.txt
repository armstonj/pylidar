How to create a distribution of PyLidar. 

1. Ensure that you have fetched and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the pylidar/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
3. Push the changes to github with "git push". 
4. Check out a clean copy of the repository into /tmp or
   somewhere similar and 'cd' into it.
5. Ensure your environment has all the extensions being built
   (Important!!). In particular, RIVLIB_ROOT, RIWAVELIB_ROOT, RDBLIB_ROOT,
   ZLIB_ROOT, LASTOOLS_ROOT and PULSEWAVES_ROOT environment vars should be
   set to valid locations. If this is not done not all files will be included
   in the zip.
6. Create the distribution tarball, using
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
   This creates both a tar.gz and a zip, under a subdirectory called dist
7. Create checksums of each of these, e.g.
       sha256sum pylidar-1.2.3.tar.gz > pylidar-1.2.3.tar.gz.sha256
       sha256sum pylidar-1.2.3.zip > pylidar-1.2.3.zip.sha256
8. Go to the https://github.com/ubarsc/pylidar/releases page, and create a 
   new release by pressing "Draft a new release". 
   You should fill in the following:
       Tag version: pylidar-A.B.C
       Release Title: Version A.B.C
       Upload files: Add the tar.gz and zip files, and their sha256 checksum files. 
       Click "Publish release"

Version Numbers.
The TuiView number is structured as A.B.C. 
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
